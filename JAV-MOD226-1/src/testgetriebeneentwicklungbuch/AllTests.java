	// This is just a place holder class
	// the magic of testing all @Test Methods is done in the Eclipse Menu: Run > Run Configurations...

	//	How to run all @Test Methods at once?
	//	1. create as many TestCases.java as needed
	//	2. create one more TestCase called AllTest.java (this is optional). And delete the sample test.
	//	3. Run the last TestCase at least once. Run as > JUnit test case 
	//	4. Under the Menu: Run > run configurations... change the setting form run single test to Run package or project, then select accordingly
